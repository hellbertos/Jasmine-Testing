# FEND Lesson 6 - Feedreader Testing
## Code Testing with the Jasmine Library

This is a testing exercise to determine that supplied code is actually doing what it is expected to do. The relevant file to be inspected is feedreader.js which is in the *./jasmine/spec/* folder.

To run this code, please download the files or clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file. Scroll to the bottom of the webpage and look for the **Jasmine** header logo within the light grey block. Beneath that you will find the test results written for the feedreader app.

###Reading the Results
Beneath the blue/green bar showing number of specs (tests) and failures, you will see variously indented entries.
* Text in black denotes a suite (or group) of tests which are testing a similar segment of functionality which it describes (i.e. The menu).
* Indented immediately below the black text is green text explaining what is being tested in a particular test. It is named in such a way as to 'complete' a sentence starting with the suite title.displayed in
* The fact that the indented test is displayed in green indicates that the test has passed.
